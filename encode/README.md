more detailed instructions may be added eventually

## "I want to encode 2000 videos."

use `videoManager.py`  
all script files are required  
fontforge is recommended, though the script will detect if it's not installed and skip that part

## "I want to encode one video."

use `videoEncoder.py`  
only `videoEncoder.py`, `subtitleConverter.py`, and `videoClasses.py` are required
