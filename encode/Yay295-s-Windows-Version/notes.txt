Before using aniop.bat you must SET 4 variables.

FILE = The relative directory to the input video file.
SS   = The opening/ending start time.
ET   = The time elapsed since the start time.
OFN  = The relative directory to the output video file.

The start and end times can be defined as HH:MM:SS[.nn], MM:SS[.nn], or SS[.nn].
Times must be in a simplified format. 150.25 and 2:30.25 are fine, but 1:90.25 is not.
If SS or ET are not SET, they will be SET to 0. ET==0 will encode to the end of the input file.


example (Moretsu Pirates Season 1 Opening 1b):
SET FILE="F:\[Coalgirls]_Moretsu_Pirates_(1920x1080_Blu-Ray_FLAC)\[Coalgirls]_Moretsu_Pirates_26_(1920x1080_Blu-Ray_FLAC)_[05083185].mkv"
SET SS=1:19.96
SET ET=90.09
SET OFN=Opening1b-MoretsuPirates
aniop encode
