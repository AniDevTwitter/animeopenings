		<h1 id="submitting-video-encodes">Submitting video encodes</h1>

		<p>Currently, thereâ€™s no proper system for submitting encodes. However, if you have something you wish to submit you can contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/QuadPiece/">Twitter</a>.</p>

		<p>Currently, there are a couple of things you should keep in mind when submitting encodes:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Videos must not be over 40 MB unless there is a special reason</li>
		<li>Videos may not exceed 3,5 mbit/s (Preferably below 3 mbit/s)</li>
		<li>Videos must be WebM files encoded with the VP8 or VP9 codec and Vorbis audio</li>
		<li>Videos may not contain subtitle tracks (Firefox doesn't cooperate well with these)</li>
		<li>The quality of the video must be acceptable. (Your submission will be checked for artifacts and blockiness)</li>
		<li>Using the encoding settings provided <a href="">here</a> does <strong>not</strong> guarantee that your encode will be perfect</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you need a place to upload your file. I recommend <a href="http://uguu.se/">Uguu</a> or <a href="http://file.quad.moe">QuadFile</a>. Again, to submit encodes. Tweet a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/QuadPiece/">@QuadPiece</a>.</p>

		<p>That might seem like a mouthful. But to keep the site running fast and users happy without exceeding our budget, some limits must be in place.</p>
